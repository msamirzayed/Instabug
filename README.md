# Instabug Task
- as for the redirecting 404 page part I could've made it using SPA library or a framework such as Angular
  making a wildcard option for the routes that don't match the paths provided * but due to lack of time &
  cause I used only Vanilla Javascript for the functionality part, I did the redirecting rules part without the wildcard option.

## all the functionality was made just by Vanilla Javascript 

## all of the Ui design was made by pure css
